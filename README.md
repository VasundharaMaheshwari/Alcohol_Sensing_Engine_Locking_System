About:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experience a shift in road safety with our project: the Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System powered by Arduino Uno. This innovative system seamlessly integrates technology and responsible driving, enhancing safety measures and promoting responsible behaviour on the road aligning with the global call for road safety improvements. 
We started with Arduino Uno basics and expanded our knowledge through extensive research and experimentation, adding a layer of complexity to the project that reflects our growth as learners. Utilizing Arduino Uno's processing capabilities, we developed a system that provides real-time data ensuring immediate and accurate results.
Debugging and fine-tuning hardware components were vital aspects of our iterative learning process.
Alcohol Detection and Engine Locking System bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical innovation. It's not just about detecting alcohol; it's about fostering a culture of responsibility and using technology to save lives. Explore the evolution from learning to innovation, all embedded in an Arduino Uno.
